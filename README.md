Welcome to the official Timberborn Modding Tools repository. This Unity project provides all the necessary tools and scripts to help you create and build your own mods for Timberborn.

It allows you to:
* Import Timberborn DLLs and assets automatically.
* Build mods directly into the correct folder structure.
* Explore example mods that demonstrate common modding workflows.

For detailed information about the entire Timberborn modding system - including Blueprints, translations, assets, UI, coding and debugging - visit the official wiki:  
https://github.com/mechanistry/timberborn-modding/wiki

The wiki covers both Unity-based workflows (using these tools) and non-Unity modding approaches (via JSON and DLL modifications).
